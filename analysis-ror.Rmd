```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

Load the packages for ROR-based singal detection and ranking:

```{r}
suppressMessages(library("PhViD"))
library("kableExtra")
```

Load the preprocessed VAERS data and transform it into the analyzable format:

```{r}
df_p <- readRDS("data-processed/df_p.rds")
df_p <- df_p[, 1:3]
df_v <- as.PhViD(df_p, MARGIN.THRES = 10)
```

Calculate the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) [@van2002comparison] and the ranking statistic --- lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval of log(ROR):

```{r}
lst_ror <- ROR(df_v, MIN.n11 = 10, DECISION = 3, RANKSTAT = 2)
df_ror <- lst_ror$SIGNALS[order(lst_ror$SIGNALS$`LB95(log(ROR))`, decreasing = TRUE), 1:6]
row.names(df_ror) <- NULL
```

View the top ranked vaccine-adverse event pairs:

```{r}
head(df_ror) %>% kable() %>% kable_styling()
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
saveRDS(df_ror, file = "data-processed/df_ror.rds")
```
